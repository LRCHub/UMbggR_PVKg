You invite me over
I come in and you're on your sofa
On your laptop
My god when do you put that shit down
I honestly don't even wanna sit down
Cause you don't even look at me
Just looking at your fucking screen
I'm about to fucking scream
I'm about to fucking scream

I never see you
I never... never never never never see you
Ever
Never never never never see you... ever
I never never never never see you
I never see you
Even when you're laying with me
I can see your mind wondering
Waiting for a notification to ring
I never...
Never never never never see you... ever
I never never never never see you
